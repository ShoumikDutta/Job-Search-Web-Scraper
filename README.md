The code is a Python script that scrapes job postings from TimesJobs website based on the user's inputted keywords. The job postings are then saved to an Excel file named 'jobs.xlsx'.

The script begins by importing the required libraries: BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas. The main function is defined that calls the getting_data and saving_data functions.

The user_input function prompts the user to enter keywords separated by commas. The input is then processed to create a string that will be used in the URL of the TimesJobs website to retrieve job postings that match the user's inputted keywords.

The getting_data function creates an empty pandas DataFrame object and sets a variable named 'condition' to True. This variable is used to control the while loop that iterates through the pages of job postings retrieved from the TimesJobs website. The 'jobs_scraped' variable keeps track of the number of job postings that have been retrieved so far. The variable 'n' is used to keep track of the page number of job postings to retrieve from the website.

Inside the while loop, the script makes a GET request to the TimesJobs website with the URL that includes the user's keywords and the page number. The HTML content of the page is then extracted using the BeautifulSoup library. The total number of job postings is extracted from the HTML and stored in the 'total' variable.

The job postings are extracted from the HTML using the find_all function from BeautifulSoup. The information for each job posting, including the position name, company, location, skills required, and link, is extracted using various functions like find and find_all from BeautifulSoup.

A dictionary is then created for each job posting, and the dictionary is appended to the pandas DataFrame object using the append method. The DataFrame object is then reset to ensure the indices are in order.

The while loop continues until all the job postings have been retrieved, and the DataFrame object is returned.

The saving_data function takes the DataFrame object returned by the getting_data function and saves it to an Excel file named 'jobs.xlsx' using the ExcelWriter method from pandas.

Finally, the main function is called, which calls the getting_data and saving_data functions. If the script is executed directly, the main function is called, and the script runs to completion.
